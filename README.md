Part 2:

A really simple solution to n if it was not an argument would be to simply print out each line individually, depending on the number u want to reach. Because of this there would be no need for input or loops, all you had to do is print 1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz… and so forth. However, what would be the point of this when the point is for the program to figure something out.

Part 3:

Writing the test for part 3 was pretty confusing at first especially since it was my first time writing a test like that. The main problem was finding the right command to use because there are a lot of commands for tests. However, after we found the right code it was very easy, so in terms of testing the solution from part 2 would be fairly easy because it would be very similar to the test for 3. The only difference would be that it is not using an array, so it would need a different command but one that is similar to the one used for part 3. The code we used for part 3 was essertEquals(); which was also listed for strings but we would need to test it to make sure it would work for our situation.

Part 4:

Essentially since each part does the same thing they all take a similar approach to the problem. For main it was the same code for input and setup the only thing that really change is how to output an array vs a list. In terms of part 2 the main difference in it was that it was automatically just printing out the answers instead of storing it to send it back to main. Comparing part 3 and 4 both turn out to be very similar because both essentially store data which can then be outputted in order giving us the answer. It ultimately doesn’t matter that much on what type of list we use because they all will work. However, and ArrayList is probably the best option simply because all we are doing is adding to the list. So we don’t need a linkedList which is great in certain situations but not necessary for this situation.
